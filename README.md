# NAME

Portable::Dist - Modify a Perl distribution to make it portable

# DESCRIPTION

The [Portable](https://metacpan.org/pod/Portable) family of modules provides functionality that allows
Perl to operate from arbitrary and variable paths.

**Portable::Dist** is used to apply the necesary modifications to an
existing Perl distribution to convert it to a Portable Perl.

## Portability Warning

This module is designed for use only on a distribution that is not
currently in use. Thus, you should not execute the modification
process using the distribution you wish to modify.

This module is also currently only designed to run on Windows (to
support the production of Strawberry Perl Portable and other
Perl::Dist-related distributions).

If you wish to use this module for other operating systems, please
contact the author.
